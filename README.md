Max 7 Abstractions

This repository is designed to collect my learning in the world of Max. 
The abstractions it contains are exercises that I impose on myself and also use them as reminder.

The Controllers folder contains abstractions related with MIDI controllers for now you can find for:

The Ableton Folder contains abstrations realted with the live API, i want to make the functions using 
the ableton specifics object and the same function  with The LiveAPI Object in Javascript.
